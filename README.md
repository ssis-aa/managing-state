### 1-1 Binary Secret Code - Introduction to Abstraction

We are moving on to Standard 6 which is about levels of abstraction. To understand what is meant by that, we're starting with a secret message in binary code

- [Binary code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kezu8lGU67GcGHCYDIvUUrRqeUwTgyaD42zFfC4XZ_0/edit?usp=sharing) as a text file

In this video, Mr. Weinberg introduces the idea of abstraction and teaches you to use Python to decrypt this binary code.

### 2-2 Three Boards, Three Flavors

Watch this short video intro to our case study for today. It shows three different microcontroller boards running three different programs that achieve the same overall goal.

### 3-1 Introduction to State Machine Programming

Based on what you did last time analyzing the code of a microcontroller board and accelerometer, this video introduces how the concept of a state machine makes this code more modular and easier to debug. The idea is to refactor the code that deals with inputs, outputs, and the logic into separate functions. This abstraction makes it easier to build more complex programs than you might otherwise be able to program.
